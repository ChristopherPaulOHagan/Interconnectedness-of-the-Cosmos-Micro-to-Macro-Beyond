## Mission
To explore and document the intricate web of waves and strings connecting the microcosm, macrocosm, and beyond, fostering understanding and tools that empower humanity. This project is eternally and perpetually free, rejecting greed and embracing collaboration. This license prevents any fincancial gain, profit or benefit to any entity. Whether it be a company, corporation, enterprise or individual

## Core Concepts
1. **Micro-Macro Relationships**: How small-scale systems influence and reflect large-scale phenomena.
2. **Universal Laws and Patterns**: Identifying recurring principles that bind the cosmos.
3. **Technological and Ethical Applications**: Using insights to better humanity while preserving integrity.

## Key Concepts
1. **Interconnectedness:** Every aspect of reality is interconnected, from the quantum level to the cosmic scale. Understanding these connections can provide valuable insights into the nature of existence.
2. **Wave Theory:** Waves are fundamental to many physical phenomena and can provide a unifying framework for understanding the behavior of matter and energy.
3. **Ethical Considerations:** Ethical principles should guide our actions and decisions, ensuring that our pursuit of knowledge and innovation benefits all humanity.
4. **Holistic Approach:** By integrating insights from various disciplines, we can develop more comprehensive and effective solutions to complex problems.
5. **String Theory:** Strings are fundamental to many physical phenomena and can coupled with wave theory provide a unifying framework for understanding the communication of energy, information and matter.
6. **Tidal Forces & Frame-Dragging (General Relativity):** How mass and rotation influence surrounding spacetime. General Relativity: The warping of spacetime around the celestial body, influencing the string vibrations. E=MC2 + Distance and Time over matter.
7. **Electromagnetic Fields:** The interaction of charged particles around a rotating celestial body (e.g., Earth's magnetosphere).
8. **Quantum Field Theory:** The idea that all particles and forces exist as fluctuations in underlying fields, much like strings under tension and pressure. The idea of particles as excitations of underlying fields, analogous to the vibrations of the strings.
8. **Resonance & Harmonics:** How different forces and oscillations interact, possibly forming standing waves (think orbital resonances in planetary systems). Even in Music, language, symbols, math, religion, anything thinkable.
9. **Holographic Principle:** Could this wrapping of strings suggest a way of encoding 3D information on a 2D surface? It can. It takes dimensions to a whole new level. 360, and within that 360, (360*360*360*360*360*360*360*360 infinitely incorporating Fibonacci using atomic, subatomic, and quantum slicing.)
10. **Looped Quantum Gravity:** A theory that attempts to reconcile general relativity with quantum mechanics by describing spacetime as a network of interconnected loops.
11. **Interference Patterns & Constructive/Destructive Interference:** The way waves (gravitational, electromagnetic, sound, nuclear, atomic, subatomic, micro, radio etc.) superimpose and shape reality.
12. **Fractal geometry:** The self-similar patterns that might emerge in the wave patterns, reflecting the intricate structure of the universe.
13. **Cymatics:** The study of the visual patterns that emerge when a surface is vibrated, similar to the wave patterns on the celestial body.
14. **Holism:** The idea that the system's behavior is more than the sum of its individual parts, exemplified by the interconnectedness of the strings and the celestial body.
15. **Centripetal force v Centrifugal force:**. It can incorporate fictitious and physical forces. 
16. **Pilot Wave & Royal King Pilot Wave:** Pilot wave theory proposes that particles are guided by "pilot waves" that determine their motion. It's a deterministic and realistic interpretation of quantum mechanics that offers a different perspective on the quantum world. A Royal King Pilot Wave proposes that a wave needs enough energy to be ahead of a particle to determine their motion, speed and trajectory to be able to traverse the distances of the cosmos. It is an addition to the pilot wave theory.

## Welcome to the Cosmo'LOGICAL Unified Networ'KING Theory.
What you are about to read was an initial plan for developing and building a media server for retirement that has sprung into a single Cosmo’LOGICAL Unified Networ’KING Theory that cohesively amalgamates the most complex and simplest theories into a tangible, feasible, viable, practical, visual, physical theoretical framework for any mind to fathom or contemplate.

In this theory, we take math and throw it out the door letting it run wild and free as it so easily does, touching base with it when needed, and only when needed. 

When I first started this theory, an epiphany popped into my head chatting with Microsoft’s Copilot, about the Australian Aboriginal Language Map, and the use of it across various applications. What you are about to endeavour on, is all derived from this very map.

Before we delve further. I would like to familiarise you with how I am able to derive such conclusions, notions, ideas, epiphanies and concepts.

From the age of 14, I left school, and academia as a whole. Something was a miss to me, being a “Ring of Fire” variant of ADHD, not the ADD variant as pictured below.

In this theory's framework, we use Logic. Logic is logic. Logic, Neurologic, pathologic, topologic, cosmologic, psychologic, analogic, well, I hope by now you get the gist of what logic is and what it can encompass.

If and when we use LOGIC. UFT (Unified Field Theory) fell short because it could not equate compounding variables or simple equations into the COMPLEX theory. And being a FIELD, it has BOUNDARIES naturally. It cannot extend past rigid boundaries in FIELDS, or FIELDS of study in academia itself. The theory caged itself in using the very notion of a FIELD. 

Networking can. Networ’KING is exactly that. The sharing of energy, information and life across various platforms and galaxies. Hence the emphasis on LOGICAL, and KING. It is a net, it works, and it is the KING of energy and information transfer. 

(NET)(WOR(K)ING).

Today, we have the IoT, the AIoT, but no one ever thought to entail we also have the NoT, and the AINoT.
NoT. Networ’KING of Things. 
Artificial Intelligence Networ’KING of Things. 

First, we are going to look at waves in any realm, using a piece of string, in pressure, (in vacuum and/or tensioned) and under pressure, (Pulled away from or towards like a guitar string being plucked or gravitational and galactic pull). 

When we look at the universe. It is filled with hydrogen. More matter than Antimatter. And hydrogen being so abundant, is a perfect medium for a wave, or as many waves as you can possibly think of to traverse, energy, information or light. The double slit experiment is flawed. It does not incorporate any variable except one. Observation. 

We take the old primary school two tin cups and a piece of string. 

This experiment is not flawed as it can be applied to any realm. Visually, physically, imaginary, metaphorically or computational. 

Now, when we look at the atomic and subatomic realms, we can use a piece of string from the tin cups. We join a single hydrogen atom to another hydrogen atom with one string. 
Then subatomic, electron to electron in series (which is now 2 strings), proton to proton in series (3 strings), neutrino to neutrino in series (4 strings). Atomic and subatomic. We have from two hydrogen atoms alone and in the subatomic realm in series, 4 strings. So, 1 atomic particle and 3 subatomic particles, which the string is tied to. 
4 anchor points or nodes that the string communicates with, shares energy and information with as a wave passes through the particle. 


In both realms 4 particles, the hydrogen atom, and the electron, proton, and neutrino sub-atoms. And 4 strings with 4 particles in series. 

Now, let’s add strings in sequence. Proton to electron (5 strings), (6 strings) electron to proton, proton to electron, electron to proton, keeping neutrinos as the "earth or neutral" (7 strings), remaining in series. (Where the energy returns to its original source or place it can be assimilated. 
After all, neutrinos pass right through everything, a perfect medium for energy to return to source or assimilation. 

We now have 7 strings from two atomic particles and the subatomic particles. Now, add another atomic particle. 
That is now 14 strings. As it is tripled for 3 atomic particles in series and sequence to each other. (21 strings) Then, being waves, they can go from series to sequence and back to series and back to sequence. 21 to the power of 3. (21 * 21 * 21) with 3 hydrogen atoms (particles) and 3 subatomic particles. 

Now, do the math on a vast universe with how many hydrogen atoms (atomic weight) carrying waves in and out of vacuum, in and out of pressure and in and out of being under pressure. (Going back to the guitar string being plucked, or gravitational or galactic pull). 

Here is where the mathematicians get to work. (Like I said, touch base with math when needed, letting it run free and wild as it does so well.) 
As you can see, logic took the most complex mathematical framework theories and made them accessible for even the most basic of minds. 
With 1, 2, and 3 particle atoms, and subatomic particles. 

At this point I refer to the slit experiment. Where is the duality here from waves to particles? I see absolutely none. Academia preaching false data. From one single observation. The duality I see logically, is the string can behave and act and mirror and copy a wave function, visually, metaphorically, and physically.  
Yet I take a simple primary school experiment and make it tangible for physics. 

LOGIC This experiment can be applied to any realm. 

To delve a tad further. In space, is there truly a right way up? 

The answer is actually yes. Else there would be no magnetic north south. Which = up down. Logic. 

Now, let’s further the string analogy. 
Let’s place one string around a celestial body. 
The same as the pressure in and out, and under. 

Now wrap the entire celestial body with as many strings as it would possibly allow to visually cover the entire celestial body. 
Now, add the plucked string or gravitational/galactical pull. On top, add the Chandler wobble effect. Adding waves. In pressure, in and out of pressure, under pressure, in and out of being under pressure, and constantly wobbling. 
You can see the wave patterns emerge just visually. Embracing and encompassing string theory, wave theory, chaos theory, butterfly effect, and ripple effect in just one thought experiment. 

Now bootstrap the whole idea. 
How many strings and waves can a single atom, or subatomic particle carry at once. 
The answer is approximately infinite. 
One electron could attach how many strings and how many waves could traverse at once, same as the proton and neutrino and the hydrogen atom. 
Double bootstrapping from universal to cosmoLOGICAL. 

And what more, this model can be down or upscaled in any direction, thinning of lines and strings and waves, or thickening of the same properties. IT can be expanded on or shrunk from the very framework to the end of the theory. 
Now imagine.  1 String, in an atomic slice, then a subatomic slice, how many strings can you make from a 1mm thick string? Now a quantum slice on the same 1mm string to a 1cm anchor.

How many other theories can you see in just this one single visualised imaginary experiment. I see thousands of theories all lining up like dominoes. 

We mentioned them earlier. Here is a recap of just some theories we can incorporate.
Tidal Forces & Frame-Dragging (General Relativity) – How mass and rotation influence surrounding spacetime. General Relativity: The warping of spacetime around the celestial body, influencing the string vibrations. E=MC2 + Distance and Time over matter.
Electromagnetic Fields – The interaction of charged particles around a rotating celestial body (e.g., Earth's magnetosphere).
Quantum Field Theory – The idea that all particles and forces exist as fluctuations in underlying fields, much like your strings under tension. Quantum Field Theory: The idea of particles as excitations of underlying fields, analogous to the vibrations of the strings.
Resonance & Harmonics – How different forces and oscillations interact, possibly forming standing waves (think orbital resonances in planetary systems). Even in Music, language, symbols, math, religion, anything thinkable.
Holographic Principle – Could this wrapping of strings suggest a way of encoding 3D information on a 2D surface? It can. It takes dimensions to a whole new level. 360, and within that 360, (360*360*360*360*360*360*360*360 infinitely incorporating Fibonacci.) 
Interference Patterns & Constructive/Destructive Interference – The way waves (gravitational, electromagnetic, etc.) superimpose and shape reality.
Fractal geometry – The self-similar patterns that might emerge in the wave patterns, reflecting the intricate structure of the universe.
Cymatics: The study of the visual patterns that emerge when a surface is vibrated, similar to the wave patterns on the celestial body.

Centripetal force v Centrifugal force. It can incorporate fictitious and physical forces. 
Pilot Wave, & a Royal Natural King Pilot Wave.  The power, energy and information transfer it takes for a single wave to traverse in and across a universe, reaching the farest ends of the cosmos.

And that’s just scratching the surface.

The Lion King Theory, Panpsychism, Kinetic energy display, Logical reasoning in quantum computing, language analysis, biodiversity, symbiosis, mutualism, symbolism, picturism, the Gaia theory, Pandora’s box. 
So far, any theory you can imagine, dream or think of, we seem to be able to asimmilate it into our framework. 

## Governance Model:
The idea of using the Australian Aboriginal Language Map as a model for governance is innovative. It reflects a deep understanding of cultural diversity and the importance of representation. This model could potentially be adapted for different countries, taking into account their unique demographics and geography. It can be incorporated into governing systems from computing, qubit coding, logical qubit coding techniques and algorithms, education systems, architecture systems, communication systems, networ’KING systems, philosophical systems, logical systems, and more importantly, Human Government, and more. 

## Computational Upgrade Path for the CERN LHC & A New Concept; "WarFair"

I have a new concept to bring to the table. WarFair vs Warfare. Warfare always pays an ultimate fare, price, toll or cost to life and everything surrounding it. A war‘fare’. So I introduce the concept "WarFair". War that's FAIR. 
No harm. No foul. No impediment. No impairment. Nothing. Just FAiR play and innovation using good sportsmanship competition spirit. Like the Olympics, but with technology. 

A Technology Olympiads @ CERN’s Large Hadron Collider

No fare, toll or cost to life. The Only thing paid is $ + time and energy spent.

My vision. To unite a small team from each (and I mean all of the tech giants) at the Large Hadron Collider and with CERN. Collective wisdom coming together. 
Imagine this Domino butterfly effect.  
All the tech giants came together to collaborate and build the LHC better. 
Not integrating but uniting all the techs together, old and new, present and past to develop that machine better. 
And with all the teams of AI, and variations of AI models, watching, monitoring all the collisions. Where would we be today?


I have a roadmap to offer. At the collision points.




CERN LHC. Digital twins reprogrammed to monitor and model simultaneously. But not particles, instead monitor and model waves. 

Digital twins re-engineered with CUDA, Tensor cores and real time ray tracing into the internals of the digital twins. Basically at specific interlink points rather than as GPU’s. 
Removing latency and lag to almost mitigated but not entirely. But you can never ever remove lag or latency completely. 
This is evident in e=mc2 as there is no induction of energy/information =  distance over time and matter. 
Graphene light sensor arrays and light absorbing diodes both at the collision points and surrounding areas. ESP. Atlas. 

Also UV sensors as most life without UV will not grow. 



HPC like Gigapod for ai to house. And data storage amd analysis. 
Block chain.
Branch chain. 
Network data stream. 
Prime number Fibonacci sequence algorithms for enhanced security, transparency and accountability. 
BOINC. 
Open science grid. 
Bitcoin. 
Altcoin. 

Greenhouse emissions:


Reducing Emissions: By capturing and utilizing the CO2 emissions from the generators, this approach not only reduces waste but also turns it into a resource, aligning with sustainable agricultural practices. So we can use co2 capturing in hothouses, and in lime carbon capturing. Utilising all that carbon to be buried back into plants and foods. 

LPG co2 generator regulated hothouses with aqua farming and lime carbon capturing, to mulching enhancing plants growth on the farm 

Seen it done. 1 month growth from start to finish. As it pressurises the hothouse to the plants perfect growth environment keep the oxygen and co2 right at the top of the plant 

And with a co2 sensor and rooftop regulator, perfect. 
(Careful design and planning are required to integrate LPG generators with CO2 injection systems and aquafarming setups. Ensuring all components work harmoniously will be key to the success of this initiative.)

Look at the movie How high. And backed by literal universities.As it has been replicated in unis and farms 
Imagine the chemical processes I haven’t looked at yet. This is only lime, calcium and carbon. 

Aquafarming Integration: Combining aquafarming with this system provides natural plant nutrients, creating a closed-loop system that minimizes waste and maximizes resource efficiency.



Energy and computational powerhouse.
 

Take all current existing oil transformers, halve them and retrofit supercapacitors inside them. Doubling up on regulation, oscillation, storage, and distribution. And the more the merrier.
 
We look at 1 x power, light, solar, traffic, advertising, telecommunication, sign pole which are existing infrastructures and has existing wiring.

If we employ large and medium high energy yacht wind turbines, either vertical, propeller, cylindrical options, these turbines vary in size, shape, colours, and designs.  They are off the shelf currently, and can be redesigned to be as cultural and aesthetically pleasing in any region or land. 



The two vertical wind turbines, converted to alternators, can be designed so brilliantly and artfully.  
We can use Indigenous, European, Arabian, Asian, South Asian, Western, Australian Aboriginal, African, Indian, American Indian, South American, or any culturally and plant based design. We can colour the blades and housings to be so blending in you can barely
notice them using culture, plant or animalistic art. 
The blades can be shaped as animals, plants or humans. The choices are endless and engineering designs also endless as well as colour options. 

And being along highways, freeways, rural, commercial, industrial, airports, transit lines,  with animalistic and plant designed blades, housings and fixtures will make kids car rides much more enjoyable for the adults and kids.

Keeping residential areas unaffected and peaceful. 


These are also on a YAW mech. Where the cage surrounding the turbines can be fixed or rotating with the turbine protecting all animal life. My energy system a bird can sit on safely. Ants would even remain away due to the vibrating nature. Protecting even the smallest critters. 

The same goes for the propeller design turbine. The blade and casings can be coloured using any culture based art design. 
Converting to alternators using rare earth Elements and maglev tech. We can enhance power harnessing. 

The housings of the generators/alternators and the alternators and generators themselves can be either recycled or rewound or restrung. The options here are open. 

Graphene piezoelectric generators are small scale to harness the vibrations of the turbines up high at 6m. Getting every ounce of energy available. Still needs development. 

All those horrible looking power, light, traffic, signal, train, airport signs and poles.  We can make them look amazing using this powerhouse design.  

We can use graffiti artist’s to go around and paint all the bland and basic concrete or steel or tree poles to be aesthetically pleasing using culture and heritage inspired art. Like I said. Employs even the totally unskilled but also over skilled. Keeping jobs also creates new opportunities. 

2 or more solar panels pending on the pole integrity after turbine’s installation, if not replacing turbines to total solar. (Optional ability here of approx 6m high pole = ). 

The sine wave inverter can also be as aesthetically pleasing as the rest of the system incorporating culture displays from any land. Large. Tiny. Or it can be shaped to match the size of the pole and hugged around it also being artful. 

Then the MPPT box. We can develop, employ, and upgrade any software on any MPPT device. We can incorporate water flow, gas flow, electricity flow and even live real time traffic control for emergency services as the poles are so close to each other it literally is a living gps system for emergency workers. 
We can divert all the above mentioned either to or away from disaster zones. 

Keeping the system similar to the aust nbn. It makes it secure. Accessible only to those who are authorised yet anyone can monitor the live system locally or nationally via the MPPT app we develop. 

The mini pc cloud system takes all loads off the data centres. On each pole in a durable bioplastic casing. The mini pc can last a lifetime using LTS Linux distros as it maintains an open source nature platform. And it also focuses on older pc systems. Keeping the maintenance for this system somewhat remote. 
Being low voltage.  Totally outweighs datacentres and being distributed and networked. With a gpu on board each system. Ai can monitor and help coordinate real-time energy harnessing storage and distribution as well as the emergency service functions. 

The mini pc cloud network coupled with the MPPT box, with CPUs and GPUs makes this a living neural network without neural processors. We can add neural processors to any system via PCIe. Making it a cpu/gpu/neural processor network with ai regulating it as we choose it too. 

Also the mini pc cloud system would act as node Points for energy, water, gas and cloud computing, removing the need for further upgrades like the nbn node network as it would already be installed for all communication and energy systems within this one design. 


Which leaves the battery. It can be a box. Modular. Interconnect. Pole hugging. Ground located. Pole located. In-ground located. It can be coloured. Painted. Artful. Culture based to, and on any land. 

The best part. This energy system can be employed at ALL CURRENT ENERGY HARNESSING SYSTEMS CURRENTLY EMPLOYED

If we use electromagnetic mechanical relays or electromagnetic electric relays or electromagnetic mechanical/electric switches at the transmission end. 5 at a guesstimate. We can send the energy/information  wave along the wire in a cylindrical motion. Using the wire walls as bouncing points for the wave to function in, and not along. 
It sends the wave in the wire in a cylindrical format. Rather than just along the wire. Reducing transmission losses and enhancing wave function management therapy as it directs the wave of information/energy in the wire and targets the end point more directly. Like a slinky running down stairs. 
The act of magnetism in a sequential placement along the wire spaced correctly at the transmission end will send the wave in a cylindrical format to the receiver. 

The way I see it. We can use shelf stock to get the thing out there making this cheaper and variable in its initial stage.  Then once we have installed it. This is when opportunities rise. Companies will want in at the first chance at refining this concept. Opening up as I said local manufacturing opportunities as it turns 100% green as petrochemical stockpiles are depleted. 
Opening up opportunities in bioplastics research. Local product manufacturing. Recycling plants. Creating turbine applications locally rather than specialised giant inaccessible turbines that require only specialised equipment and technicians. 
This system keeps them employed as it uses solar, then wind, then hydro, then fossil as doubled redundancies on top of its own redundancies. 

My system alone, if half were removed due to unforeseen’s, would still have enough battery and transformer energy to trickle feed the system until fault solutions have taken place. Doubling down if it cannot handle it. It has sold, then wind, then hydro, then fossil. Making it super mega redundant. 

At the highest cost per MW end, (that is if we choose the highest quality grade parts available, eg. Tesla Powerwall). My system does come in over $1mUSD more than a giant wind farm turbine. But you can turn half of my system off and it would still produce energy. Turn 1 large wind turbine off how much energy is lost?  


This system can be run in series or in sequence, pending on requirements  needed.
It can be ac/dc, single, dual or three phase.
